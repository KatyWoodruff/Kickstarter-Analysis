# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Analyzing Kickstarter data to find trends

### Using Kickstarter trends to create a successful campaign

## Using Excel I analyzed different Kickstarter campaign information to find trends for what made a campaign successful or not. Some challenges presented were finding outliers in order to that all data was relevant to the analysis.

### Challenges for this analysis were making sure eto sort out outliers in the data, and creating the correct formulas to analyze the outcomes based on goals

## Results

## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-Campaigns that have launch dates starting in May through August are more likely to be successful.
Launching a campaign during the months of December and January creates a higher risk for failer of the campaign.
## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-Creating a kickstarter with a goal of over 40,000 increases the chances that the campaign will fail.
Campaign goals of less than 5,000 or between 30,000 to 45,000 have a greater likelyhood of being successful.
## What are some limitations of this dataset?
-It does not give a full breakdown of each backer's pledged amounts and what tiers were available for backers, which could be useful to determine trends among different campaign tiers. 
## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-We could analyze the amount of backers and amount pledged versus the launch date in order to find what times of year people are more likely to back a campaign. 
Analyzing the length of each campaign could give more insight into how successful a campaign is based off of it's length.
